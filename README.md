# ChessGameAI
Python based chess game that has a minmax algorithm
This is my first python project, if there are any mistakes or possibilites for efficiencies please send a pull request :)

Currently the choice to play against AI or human has to be changed within the source code. I will get onto that ASAP. For now default setting will be black as AI and white as the player

Controls:
Click on a piece with left mouse click and valid moves for the piece will highlight, click any of these squares to move the piece
R is to reset the board
Z is to undo the move (currently gimmicky if trying to undo AI move)

And that's really it you can now go on to play the game of chess and hopefully win!
